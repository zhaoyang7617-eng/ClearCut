/**
 * C.13 — Compound clip / nested-sequence navigation stack.
 *
 * ClearCut's [Clip] model already supports `isCompound` + `compoundClips`
 * (a clip can carry an ordered list of child clips that act as its
 * "sub-timeline"). What's missing from the editor UX is the navigation
 * affordance: tap a compound clip → enter its sub-timeline → edit
 * children → exit back to the parent.
 *
 * This object owns the navigation state. The Composable layer reads
 * [currentLevel] to decide whether to render the parent timeline or a
 * child sub-timeline; on enter / exit it calls [push] / [pop] / [reset].
 *
 * Pure Kotlin so the editor's state-restoration path (autosave, recovery
 * dialog) can serialize the breadcrumb list directly.
 *
 * ## Why a separate object vs holding the stack inside EditorViewModel
 *
 * Keeping the nav stack self-contained means the autosave / archive layer
 * has a clear single object to round-trip when restoring an editor
 * session in a sub-timeline (a user who quit while editing a compound
 * clip should resume in that compound clip's sub-timeline, not at the
 * root). The same self-contained shape also tests cleanly on the JVM
 * without spinning up the full EditorViewModel.
